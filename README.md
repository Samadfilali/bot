# CoreBot

Bot Framework v4 core bot sample.

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to:

- Use [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai) to implement core AI capabilities
- Implement a multi-turn conversation using Dialogs
- Handle user interruptions for such things as `Help` or `Cancel`
- Prompt for and validate requests for information from the user
- Use [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/cloudservices) to monitor your bot

## Prerequisites

This sample **requires** prerequisites in order to run.

### Overview

This bot uses [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai), an AI based cognitive service, to implement language understanding.

### Create a LUIS Application to enable language understanding

The LUIS model can be found under `CognitiveModels/FlightBooking.lu` and the LUIS language model setup, training, and application configuration steps can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-v4-luis?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=cs).

The folder "1-Extraction Data Luis" show you how to generate this model 
Once you created the LUIS model, update `config.py` with your `LuisAppId`, `LuisAPIKey` and `LuisAPIHostName`.

```json
  "LuisAppId": "Your LUIS App Id",
  "LuisAPIKey": "Your LUIS Subscription key here",
  "LuisAPIHostName": "Your LUIS App region here (i.e: westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com)"
```
